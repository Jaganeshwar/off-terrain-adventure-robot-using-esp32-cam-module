# off-terrain-adventure-robot-using-esp32-cam-module
this project is used to explore rough terrain, capture images or videos using the ESP32-CAM module, and possibly navigate autonomously. The robot's design will require a sturdy chassis, suitable motors, and efficient power management. With the ESP32-CAM module, you can stream video feed, detect objects, and control the robot remotely. This project combines robotics, programming, and electronics, offering a great opportunity to learn and experiment. By refining the robot's performance, you can create a versatile and reliable explorationÂ tool.
